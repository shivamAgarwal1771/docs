1. Understand Superset’s Data Refresh & Caching
Superset does not directly schedule dashboard refreshes, but it schedules and caches queries run by charts.

The caching layer stores results of your chart queries for a certain time (CACHE_TIMEOUT).

When cache expires or is invalidated, Superset re-runs the underlying SQL queries on the database.

2. Methods to Refresh Data Automatically
A. Use Superset’s Built-in Query Scheduling (via Celery & Scheduler)
Superset supports scheduling queries to run periodically using Celery and the Superset Scheduler.

The Scheduler runs SQL Lab queries and charts at configured intervals, populating cache.

This means when your dashboard loads, it fetches data from the cache — making refresh fast.
